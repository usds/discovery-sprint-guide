# Delivering the Sprint Findings
During the sprint, your team will have amassed a lot of data in multiple types of formats. It is important to create artifacts of what was covered during the sprint as a “leave-behind” for your stakeholders. We recommend writing your documents at a level of depth that doesn’t require you to be in the room with the reader as we have seen reports go dormant and then get reinspired. 

### Sprint deliverables
Typically, we produce some or all of the following deliverables:

- **An Executive Summary** (2 pages max) that identifies the sprint challenge and scope, the research the team did, and the high-level findings and recommendations (this is often shared with stakeholders in advance of the rest of the report)

- **A short written Sprint Report** (5 - 10 pages) to the organization’s stakeholders which includes the executive summary, observations, anonymous quotes, recommendations and potential next steps. 

- **A formal slide presentation** (optional) that summarizes the report, since the report is delivered in person to the same group of stakeholders that were present for the kickoff meeting at the beginning of the sprint. 

- **A quick prototype** (depends on sprint) may be created to illustrate a point of concept but this is rare and depends on the discovery sprint scope and needs 

Make sure to leave a proper amount of time to create these deliverables as these will live on long after the team disbands. These items are the results of the sprint.

### Start the first draft of the sprint report early

We have found that it’s really never too early to start writing an outline or draft of your report deliverables. Even after the first couple of days of interviews you should start to have some good data and maybe an outline of the story that you will be telling. 

In your end-of-day team check-ins talk about what you saw and heard, what you learned, what you feel like you still don’t know and use those insights and questions to drive the next day’s work. The Sprint lead can take notes, and these notes will start to become an outline. During week two of the sprint you’ll be starting to write and edit your work. 

A good discovery sprint report captures the current state of affairs, unearths gaps and opportunities, and sets clear recommendations for action moving forward. Recommendations should be actionable and address the severity of issues and potential impacts. The scope of the effort both in rough time and resources necessary should also be included for each recommendation. The report should also distinguish between things the organization could do now and long-term potential work. You won’t have been able to dig deeply into every aspect of the organization during your 2 weeks, so it is fine to include unknowns and areas you would have liked to explore but didn’t get a chance to. 
 
Recommendations do not need to be technology fixes. Discovery efforts frequently uncover opportunities to move or empower existing staff, or additionally hire missing roles or expertise (either directly or via vendor contracts). Organizational changes could be just as useful as building or buying more software or hardware. That said, government systems advance by the decade, so it is also possible that something that was an expensive custom-built solution that hasn’t aged well, may now be replaceable with off the shelf solutions. The other type of recommendation we may make are policy changes. This can happen for two reasons: one, available technology may have advanced beyond the limits of the current federal policy and two, over time an organization may be constrained by their interpretation of an existing policy and a fresh review may reveal new potential approaches.

See the <a href="/writing/">writing guide</a> for in-depth details on writing the discovery sprint report.

### Final stakeholder review

At USDS we have occasionally run into situations where a sprint report document can have unintended audiences or consequences. We now make it a best practice to have a bureaucracy hacker and members of our leadership team review final drafts of deliverables before they are considered “done” or ready to deliver. This can also a review from folks in your organization in public relations, policy, or legal. You should also have a plain language expert review your report to ensure it's easy to read and understand. A fresh pair of eyes for a final edit is always recommended. 

### Readout and presentation to stakeholders
Ideally the sprint lead was able to pre-schedule the executive stakeholders for a readout meeting date as close to 3 or 4 weeks out from the kick-off date as possible. This will ensure that momentum stays high during the sprint, and that the sprint team is able to deliver their findings while everything is top of mind. 
 
During the sprint readout, walk through the team’s findings, answer any questions the organization might have, and discuss next steps. The team should print out a few paper copies to bring to the meeting. At the onset, make acknowledgments - thank leadership and the staff you worked with for their time and efforts. 
 
The team should then walk through what they did, their research, and how they came to the findings and opportunities. The team should NOT walk through the report itself. Use this time to share stories that the team heard during research to cement why the team proposed the findings and recommendations. It is important that the sprint team understands where the organization is coming from and delivers the results of the sprint in a way that resonates with them. The research the team has done should inform this.
