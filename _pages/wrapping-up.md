# Wrapping up the Sprint
Once you have delivered a final report to your internal and external stakeholders, there still may be some things that need to be done to wrap up. Because of the transitional nature of project work, acknowledge and prepare for the fact that if further work is done coming out of the sprint, it may not be the individuals who were on the sprint team who staff any next step efforts. Make time to do some or all of the following activities: 

### Internal presentations to Sprint team leadership and others
- Sprint lead or team members may be called upon to give recommendations about any further engagement moving forward 
- A new team may be staffed up to help the organization with next steps

### Internal: Team presentation to internal teams
- This is the equivalent of a show-and-tell for our internal USDS team
- Helps everyone understand and talk about the kind of work that USDS does
- Helps colleagues have some context if/when there is an ask for further staff to deploy on any further work driven by the sprint 

### Internal: Team retrospective
- A chance for the team to reflect on the work that they did
- Get someone who wasn’t involved to run the session
- Blameless
- The entire team should participate
- 90 - 120 minutes
   - Part one: Spend the first hour recapping, tell the story of the sprint end to end
   - Part two: What went well, what didn’t go well, lessons for future sprints
   - Give everyone a chance to have a voice
   - Should our involvement with this organization continue? In what way?

### Next steps: Follow-up with the organization
- Sometimes there are residual meetings
- We may have offered to assist with something specific beyond the sprint
- We may enter into conversations about longer project engagement 
- Offer to have sprint team members give lunch-time brown-bag presentations to the organization’s personnel about human-centered design best practices
