# Conducting the Discovery Sprint

Part of having a successful sprint is your team’s attitude from the start. Approach the work and the team’s relationships within the organization constructively and positively. You’ll be talking to many people and gathering as much information about the current state of the organization as possible. The meat of the sprint is two weeks of intensive work. It’s crucial to stick to the two-week time commitment to keep everyone focused and the sense of urgency high.
 
>On rare occasions, depending on team size and resource availability, it may be appropriate to extend the length of the sprint a few days (for intensive usability testing or specific travel, for instance), but it’s important to look back to the goals of the sprint and avoid scope creep—you are not here to do a full project or create solutions.

It is also important to figure out the sprint’s north star and check in on this often. Otherwise, sprints happen so quickly that it’s easy a team can lose sight of this. North stars are often a combination of organizational goals, team goals, and USDS values. Good “north star” targets are flexible enough to accommodate new information but fixed enough to serve as guidelines for if a particular interview or investigation path is worth the team’s time. Ultimately, your north star should tell you what you are trying to accomplish with the sprint.

The team is on the sprint to help an organization look at something with fresh eyes and start to have a conversation with them about where they could go. The team should be realistic about what they can accomplish in two weeks and make sure to loop in their sprint stakeholders to get their feedback as well. Lastly, as the sprint team uncovers more information, the team should constantly refocus and reprioritize to respond accordingly.

 > It is the sprint team’s role to uncover what the organization’s needs are, understand the big picture, and provide recommendations that are realistic to achieve, taking into account what is actually possible for the organization to implement. 

### Sprint Expectations
As a sprint team participant, be proactive and self-organize. The sprint lead is there to help direct the team, but team members should take initiative and have the freedom to chase things down. The time will move quickly and tasks can change daily – or even hourly. Schedules and meetings should be fluid to make sure the team is using the time wisely for everyone involved. Patience, flexibility, and communication are key.

Here are some tips to keep in mind and revisit often during the research phase:
 
- Work from a learning mindset: you are there to learn from and enable your partners
- The organization has tremendous expertise and will have expended significant effort in this problem space already
- You are very likely not the first team that has shown up to them about these issues
- They are also setting time aside for you on top of their other responsibilities 
- Remember that the point of discovery is to look for the root causes and opportunities
 
It can be easy to fall back to a mode of just identifying all the problems and why they are harmful.  It’s easy for anyone to see the problems. There are often reams of paper, and a big backlog that detail these shortcomings. This is only part of the work. The goal of the sprint is not to add to that pile of paper. It's important to identify practical, pragmatic steps the organization can take to drive improvements and change. 

### Typical Day
The bulk of each day will be spent meeting with agency stakeholders and customers so begin and end each day with a team stand-up. Set goals and expectations and review the day’s schedule in the morning. Recap accomplishments, discuss any findings, and plan for the next day in the evening. When you are moving and learning this quickly, staying grounded with your team is key. 
 
Oftentimes, stakeholders want to know why they are talking to sprint team members so being clear with your quick pitch will be helpful. During the day, build in breaks to keep the team in sync and for periodic sharing and reflections. It is also helpful to start a document where team members can add high-level notes and keep track of potential items to explore. The sooner you can get a rough framing of your findings, the easier the report writing phase will go.
 
### Sample Schedule
On day one of the sprint, the sprint lead should have already pre-scheduled interviews with the organization’s relevant stakeholders and users so that the team can get started right away. See the <a href="/interview/">interview guide</a> for in-depth details on how to conduct interviews.
 
The team is there to learn as much about the organization as possible. It’s good to start talking with managers and leads, but also important to talk with individual contributors who are as close to the work as possible (engineers, contractors, analysts, call center operators, etc). You are there to respectfully surface areas for improvement, and, even more importantly, to look for ways to offer practical, tactical recommendations for how to achieve these improvements. 
 
**Beginning of Week One:**
- Start of day: Quick team stand-up (the schedule for the day, who is doing what, give any blockers to the sprint lead) 
- Conduct individual interviews (leadership, stakeholders, staff, and users)
- Lunch: Team debrief, any changes going into the afternoon
- Conduct individual interviews, chasing down leads from morning interviews
- End of day: Team debrief and set-up for the next day

**Middle of Week One:**
- Continue team check-ins throughout the day as above
- Continue interviews; request more if needed depending on findings
- Talk to and observe end users if possible
- Have the team brain dump all you have learned in a structured way, formulate a hypothesis, and surface areas where you still have questions
- Make a list of those questions, and figure out who else you need to talk to - devise a plan to talk to those people

**End of Week One:**
- Continue team check-ins throughout the day as above
- Hold interviews with SMEs to answer any outstanding questions
- Continue talking to and observing people and processes
- Check in with key stakeholders to review findings to date; iterate as necessary based on their feedback
- Schedule interviews with additional people identified for the next week
- Brainstorm with the team on potential recommendations, using methods like affinity mapping
- Begin to structure findings and recommendations into an outline

>Remember that, while in some instances there’s a clear path to a solution, the answer is not limited to technology. The team’s job during the research phase is to review, not only the technology, but also the roles, mindsets, processes and policy. 
 
Take time every day for the team to share out what they have learned, debrief, and discuss possible next steps. This prevents sprints from going down specific paths too quickly and is useful for re-focusing the team and providing concrete next steps. As the team collects notes and interviews, themes will emerge that will help target the sprint activities. 
 
Ideally, by the end of the first week, you should have some concrete directions to chase down and should spend the second week more focused on those areas. Focus on getting as complete a picture as possible of the current state of the organization and the history that led up to it. Spend time understanding organizational dynamics and relationships, and identify decision points, pain points, and aspirations.

**Beginning of Week Two:**
- Get together as a team to pull threads identified in week one
- Define the team’s deliverables for the conclusion of the sprint
- Narrow in on a handful of findings that would make sense for the report 
- Converge on areas to focus on for week two
- Continue interviews, following up on the key outstanding questions
- Begin draft report and presentation based on outline from week one

**Middle of Week Two:**
- Continue team check-ins to debrief and share findings and insights
- Update the team’s affinity map of findings throughout the week
- Continue talking to and observing people and processes
- Start to figure out how to deliver your recommendations 
 
**End of Week Two:**
- Wrap up any outstanding interviews
- Determine the deadlines and outputs for the week three
- Check in with key stakeholders to review findings to date; iterate as necessary based on their feedback
- Continue to refine the draft report and presentation


Once the sprint team has a good understanding of the organization and its challenges, the team should tailor their approach to what makes sense for the organization. A project or initiative that is just starting is going to be in a different place than one that has a large backlog that needs to be resolved. 

### Regular reporting to your stakeholders 
Part of the responsibilities of the sprint lead is to maintain good communication with the organization stakeholders throughout the duration of the sprint. This can be done using whatever methods make sense for the people involved (phone calls, emails etc.), daily and or weekly check-ins help keep everyone on the same page.

Remember that your senior stakeholders are the ones who will bear the responsibility of anything you discover as well as all the recommendations in your report. It’s better not to surprise them. Interacting with them as true partners will help you set them up for success. And allowing a key stakeholder or two to see an early draft of your findings will give them the chance to weigh in on how to message some of your reporting in ways that their organization can hear, and that they themselves can prepare for. They may not always agree with you, but they shouldn’t feel caught out either.
